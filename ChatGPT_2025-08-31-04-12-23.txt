ChatGPT:


I’ve carefully reviewed your code. Here’s a detailed evaluation, covering correctness, potential pitfalls, and style considerations.

1. General Overview

Your program:

Modifies the first 1k bytes of a file (via SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k),

Launches mpv.exe to play the file asynchronously,

Restores the original 1k bytes after playback,

Restores the original modification timestamp of the file.

It uses asynchronous programming (Task, async/await) and Process.Exited event handling.

2. Correctness
2.1 Process Handling
csharp
Copy code
myProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = String.Format("\"{0}\"", fileName);
myProcess.StartInfo.FileName = @"mpv.exe";
myProcess.StartInfo.Verb = "Open";
myProcess.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
myProcess.Exited += new EventHandler(myProcess_Exited);


✅ EnableRaisingEvents is correctly set before subscribing to Exited.

⚠ Verb = "Open" is not needed here; it’s only relevant for shell verbs (like open, print) and may conflict with directly launching an .exe. You can remove it.

✅ Wrapping Process in using ensures disposal, but be careful: disposing the Process object before the Exited event fires may cause issues. Currently, await Task.WhenAny(eventHandled.Task) is inside the using block, so it should be okay.

✅ The TaskCompletionSource pattern is valid to await Exited.

2.2 Awaiting Exited
csharp
Copy code
await Task.WhenAny(eventHandled.Task);


⚠ Task.WhenAny here is unnecessary because you’re only awaiting a single task. await eventHandled.Task; is simpler and clearer.

⚠ You had commented out a timeout. Currently, your code waits forever if mpv never exits. Consider adding a timeout to avoid potential hangs.

2.3 File Modification Logic
csharp
Copy code
DateTime originalWriteTime = File.GetLastWriteTime(filename);
SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);
...
Thread.Sleep(200);
SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);
Thread.Sleep(100);
File.SetLastWriteTime(filename, originalWriteTime);


✅ Saving and restoring file write time is correct.

⚠ Thread.Sleep is not ideal in async methods. Consider await Task.Delay(200); to avoid blocking the thread.

⚠ If SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k throws an exception, the second Do1k and timestamp restore may not execute. Wrap in try/finally to ensure restoration.

2.4 Main Method
csharp
Copy code
Task.Run(async () => {
    await Do_1k_mpv_1k(filename);
}).GetAwaiter().GetResult();


✅ This is a common pattern to call async code from a synchronous Main in .NET Framework.

⚠ Be aware: any exceptions in the async task will be thrown here synchronously.

⚠ Blocking on async code can lead to deadlocks in GUI contexts. You’re using [STAThread] but you’re not using WinForms GUI except for MessageBox. It should be fine here, but keep in mind.

3. Potential Issues / Edge Cases

File size check:

csharp
Copy code
if (length < (1024*1024)) { ... }


Works, but 1 MB is arbitrary. Consider documenting why.

mpv not found:

If mpv.exe isn’t in PATH, your code silently returns due to catch (Exception ex) { return; }. You may want to inform the user.

Concurrent calls:

Each call creates a new LaunchAndWait instance; that’s fine. No static state is being modified.

File locking:

mpv may lock the file, depending on platform and build. Your second Do1k may fail if the file is still open.

Disposal of Process inside using:

Current pattern is fine because you await the event before exiting the using. ✅

4. Style / Readability Improvements

Remove redundant semicolon here:

csharp
Copy code
myProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = String.Format("\"{0}\"", fileName);;


Prefer await eventHandled.Task; instead of Task.WhenAny.

Replace Thread.Sleep with await Task.Delay(...).

Consider try/finally around file modification to ensure restoration.

Remove StartInfo.Verb = "Open"; unless explicitly needed.

5. Suggested Improvements
csharp
Copy code
// inside Do_1k_mpv_1k
DateTime originalWriteTime = File.GetLastWriteTime(filename);

try {
    SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);

    LaunchAndWait myProcess = new LaunchAndWait();
    await myProcess.LaunchMPV(filename);

    await Task.Delay(200);
    SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);
} finally {
    await Task.Delay(100);
    File.SetLastWriteTime(filename, originalWriteTime);
}


This ensures the timestamp is always restored even if Do1k or mpv fails.

✅ Summary

Functionally correct for its purpose.

Minor issues:

Verb = "Open" not needed.

Use await Task.Delay instead of Thread.Sleep.

Consider try/finally for file restoration.

Optional: handle mpv missing or hung processes.

Otherwise, async pattern and file handling are solid.

If you want, I can rewrite the entire program with all these improvements applied, making it cleaner, safer, and fully async-friendly.

Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------------
User:


yes
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Here’s a cleaned-up, safer, fully async-friendly version of your program with all the improvements applied:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

class LaunchAndWait {

    private Process myProcess;
    private TaskCompletionSource<bool> eventHandled;

    public async Task LaunchMPV(string fileName) {
        eventHandled = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();

        using (myProcess = new Process()) {
            try {
                myProcess.StartInfo.FileName = "mpv.exe"; // must be in PATH
                myProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = $"\"{fileName}\"";
                myProcess.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
                myProcess.Exited += (sender, e) => eventHandled.TrySetResult(true);

                myProcess.Start();
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                MessageBox.Show($"Failed to launch mpv:\n{ex.Message}");
                return;
            }

            // Wait for process to exit
            await eventHandled.Task;
        }
    }

    public static async Task Do1kMpv1kAsync(string filename) {
        DateTime originalWriteTime = File.GetLastWriteTime(filename);

        try {
            // First 1k modification
            SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);

            // Launch mpv and wait
            LaunchAndWait launcher = new LaunchAndWait();
            await launcher.LaunchMPV(filename);

            // Wait a bit, then revert first 1k
            await Task.Delay(200);
            SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);
        } finally {
            // Restore original modification time
            await Task.Delay(100);
            File.SetLastWriteTime(filename, originalWriteTime);
        }
    }

    [STAThread]
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        if (args.Length == 0) return;

        string filename = args[0];
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(filename) || !File.Exists(filename)) {
            MessageBox.Show("File not found!");
            return;
        }

        long length = new FileInfo(filename).Length;
        if (length < 1024 * 1024) { // arbitrary 1MB check
            MessageBox.Show("File too small!");
            return;
        }

        try {
            Task.Run(async () => await Do1kMpv1kAsync(filename))
                .GetAwaiter()
                .GetResult();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            MessageBox.Show($"An error occurred:\n{ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}

✅ Improvements made

Removed unnecessary Verb = "Open".

Replaced Thread.Sleep with await Task.Delay.

Added try/finally to ensure file modification time is restored even if something fails.

Simplified Exited event handler with a lambda.

Added basic error messages for mpv launch failure.

Cleaned up redundant semicolons and formatting.

This version is safer, fully async-friendly, and easier to maintain.

If you want, I can also add a timeout for mpv in case it never exits, which would make it much more robust for large or locked files. Do you want me to add that?
--------------------------------------
User:


The problem is what would be the interval of the timeout? After all, this is a video player. It is quite possible to play for hours.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Ah, exactly — that’s the tricky part. A video player like mpv can run indefinitely, so a fixed timeout is dangerous: it would kill the process while the user is still watching.

Given that, there are a few safer alternatives instead of a strict timeout:

1. Rely on process exit only

Keep it fully asynchronous and just wait for mpv to exit.

This is exactly what your current code does:

csharp
Copy code
await eventHandled.Task;


✅ Safe: will never terminate the video prematurely.

⚠ Downside: if mpv crashes or hangs for some reason, your code could be stuck indefinitely.

2. Optional “soft” timeout for stuck processes

Instead of a hard cutoff, you can monitor whether the process is responding.

Example: check every few seconds if the process still exists, or has frozen.

If frozen, you can notify the user or give them the option to terminate manually.

3. Let the user close mpv manually

Since mpv has its own controls, the cleanest approach is to just wait until the user closes it.

This way you don’t arbitrarily decide how long a video can be played.

Conclusion

For your use case (video player), no timeout is appropriate. You should keep:

csharp
Copy code
await eventHandled.Task;


…as it is. The only thing to guard against is process never starting (try/catch) or file restoration on crash, which you already handle with try/finally.

If you want, I can suggest a slightly more robust version that handles the rare case of mpv not starting or crashing, without imposing a timeout on playback. It would make the program extremely safe for long videos. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------------

let's see
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Here’s a slightly more robust version that handles the rare cases of mpv not starting or crashing, without imposing any timeout on normal playback:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

class LaunchAndWait {

    private Process myProcess;
    private TaskCompletionSource<bool> eventHandled;

    public async Task LaunchMPV(string fileName) {
        eventHandled = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();

        try {
            myProcess = new Process {
                StartInfo = {
                    FileName = "mpv.exe", // must be in PATH
                    Arguments = $"\"{fileName}\""
                },
                EnableRaisingEvents = true
            };
            myProcess.Exited += (sender, e) => eventHandled.TrySetResult(true);

            if (!myProcess.Start()) {
                MessageBox.Show("Failed to start mpv.exe.");
                return;
            }
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            MessageBox.Show($"Error launching mpv:\n{ex.Message}");
            return;
        }

        // Wait for process to exit normally
        try {
            await eventHandled.Task;
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // Very unlikely, but catch any event-handling issues
            MessageBox.Show($"Unexpected error waiting for mpv exit:\n{ex.Message}");
        } finally {
            myProcess.Dispose();
        }
    }

    public static async Task Do1kMpv1kAsync(string filename) {
        DateTime originalWriteTime = File.GetLastWriteTime(filename);

        try {
            // Apply first 1k modification
            SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);

            // Launch mpv and wait for user to close
            var launcher = new LaunchAndWait();
            await launcher.LaunchMPV(filename);

            // Short delay before reverting first 1k
            await Task.Delay(200);
            SimpleHexViewer.Toggle1k.Do1k(filename);
        } finally {
            // Restore original modification time
            await Task.Delay(100);
            File.SetLastWriteTime(filename, originalWriteTime);
        }
    }

    [STAThread]
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        if (args.Length == 0) return;

        string filename = args[0];
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(filename) || !File.Exists(filename)) {
            MessageBox.Show("File not found!");
            return;
        }

        long length = new FileInfo(filename).Length;
        if (length < 1024 * 1024) {
            MessageBox.Show("File too small!");
            return;
        }

        try {
            Task.Run(async () => await Do1kMpv1kAsync(filename))
                .GetAwaiter()
                .GetResult();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            MessageBox.Show($"An unexpected error occurred:\n{ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}

What’s improved

Checks Process.Start() return value — handles the rare case mpv fails to launch.

Wraps await eventHandled.Task in try/finally with Dispose() to ensure cleanup.

Adds small try/catch blocks around process event handling for extra safety.

Keeps no timeout, so user can watch videos of any length.

Preserves the file restoration logic in finally.

This approach is safe for long-running videos while still robust against crashes or failures.

If you want, I can also replace the Task.Run(...).GetAwaiter().GetResult() pattern in Main with a fully modern async Main for better clarity in .NET 6+ style, while keeping [STAThread] for MessageBox. Do you want me to do that?
